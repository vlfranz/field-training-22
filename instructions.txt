The data:

                https://github.com/neo4j-field/field-meet-boston-2022-ps

 

This repo contains the data set.

 

Data-1000 contains the 1,000 patients data.

Data-10000 contains the 10,000 patients data.

This URL contains the data dictionary.

 

Tech Stack :

Java
Python
Javascript
.Net
Spring Data
GraphQL
 

Choose one of the tech stack to implement the solution. UI is optional.

There should be a rest endpoint to be able to invoke core operations.

 

Build the Data model. The data dictionary and data is in github.
This is the synthetic patient data set created using Synthea.
You can work with 1,000 patients data set or 10,000 patients data set or both.

Do the initial batch data load using the technology chosen.

Build API endpoints to query the graph for these aspects.
For a given patient(s) what are all the prescriptions available.
How many patients are prescribed the given drug(s).
After drug 1, how many patients had drug 2 prescribed.

Build API end points to add/update/delete data. Not batch mode. One record at a time is fine. 

Anything else you would like o showcase the tech stack efficiency.
